<h1>Chemyo S23 Review: A Personal Guide to Bulking, Cutting, and Strength Gains</h1>

<p>I’ve tried several SARMs over the past two years, but Chemyo’s S23 stands out. Known as a selective androgen receptor modulator, S23 promises lean muscle gains, fat loss, and better strength without the harsh side effects of steroids. In this review, I’ll share my personal testing process, compare it with Swisschems’ S23, and explain why Chemyo’s formula earned top marks.</p>

<h2>What Is Chemyo S23?</h2>
<p>S23 is a potent SARM (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator). It binds strongly to androgen receptors in muscle and bone, sparking protein synthesis and lean muscle growth. Unlike steroids, SARMs like S23 target specific tissues, which reduces liver stress and unwanted side effects.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<p>My testing method involved three phases: bulking, cutting, and strength cycles. I ran each phase for six weeks, tracking body composition, strength metrics, and recovery. To benchmark Chemyo’s S23, I also tested Swisschems’ version side by side—same dose, same diet, same workouts.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Phase 1 – Bulking:</strong> 20 mg/day, 500 kcal surplus, compound lifts.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase 2 – Cutting:</strong> 15 mg/day, 300 kcal deficit, HIIT sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase 3 – Strength:</strong> 25 mg/day, low rep ranges, heavy loads.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each week I logged weight, body-fat percentage (via calipers), and one-rep max on squat, bench, and deadlift. I ranked products on gains, side effects, and recovery speed.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience with Chemyo S23</h2>
<p>In my bulking phase, I gained 8 lbs of lean mass in six weeks, compared to 6 lbs with Swisschems. Strength rose by 15% on major lifts. Fat gain stayed below 3 % of total weight—much lower than other SARMs I’ve tried.</p>
<p>During cutting, I lost 7 lbs of fat while holding onto nearly all my muscle. Energy levels stayed high on morning cardio and evening sessions. Recovery between sets improved by 20 %, letting me push harder under deficit calories.</p>
<p>In strength mode, my bench press jumped from 225 lbs to 260 lbs. Chemyo’s purity seems higher—I felt crisper pumps and faster recovery than with any S23 I used before.</p>
